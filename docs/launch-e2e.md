# Launch E2E validation — 2026-07-17

The launch gate (BET-160 §2) was run against a freshly-provisioned Hetzner
VPS. The advertised one-liner did NOT produce a working box. Single launch-
blocking finding; the rest of the checklist could not be reached because the
installer exits before it does anything else.

## Headline

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1. Provision `manta-e2e` VPS | ✅ done |
| 2. Run advertised one-liner | ❌ **FAIL** — installer dies at the prereq check (node missing) |
| 3. Verify health / linger / opencode stack / relay link | ⏸ not reached — installer never unpacked |
| 4. Pair desktop through relay | ⏸ not reached |
| 5. Pair PWA + push | ⏸ not reached |
| 6. Reboot + verify reconnection | ⏸ not reached |
| 9. Delete the VPS | ✅ done |

**Pass = sections 3–6 all green (PTY exempted until BET-158).** Sections 3–6
are all "not reached" because section 2 failed. The launch gate is **NOT
passing today**.

## Environment

- **VPS**: Hetzner cx22-equivalent (`cpx11`, 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 40 GB disk),
  Ubuntu 24.04, location `ash`, name exactly `manta-e2e`, id `152016692`,
  IPv4 `178.156.203.86`. Created at `2026-07-17T12:56:37Z`.
- **Project**: the BUI Hetzner project whose token is at
  `/home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX` (used by
  reference, never echoed).
- **User**: `manta`, uid 1000, `sudo NOPASSWD:ALL`, linger enabled
  (Linger=yes), SSH keys copied from root.
- **Versions on the wire**:
  - `https://mantaui.com/install.sh` — served by Caddy, etag `dk0bm97pgfys6wj`,
    8947 bytes, content-type `text/x-shellscript`.
  - `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.tar.gz` — 200, 1,209,791 bytes,
    etag `dk04ioxhk6e8pxhb`, content-type `application/gzip`.

## Step 1 — VPS creation

```
hcloud server create \
  --type cpx11 --image ubuntu-24.04 --name manta-e2e \
  --ssh-key alphaclaw@alphaclaw --location ash
```

Returned immediately: `Waiting for create_server (server: 152016692, image:
161547269) ... done`. The token's project had `server_limit = 1` initially
(only the prod box `manta`/id 151615222 existed); the owner raised the limit
before this run (see `ace0c8be` on BET-162).

Note: the original spec said `--type cx22`, which is the legacy alias and no
longer exists; the closest current spec is `cpx11` (the smallest plan still
orderable). `cpx11` is only available in `ash` and `hil`; all the spec'd EU
locations (`fsn1`, `nbg1`, `hel1`) reject it as `Server Type unavailable`.

## Step 2 — advertised one-liner (verbatim)

```
$ curl -fsSL https://mantaui.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Actual output

```
▸ Checking prerequisites (node, npm, git, tmux, curl, tar)…
✗ missing prerequisite: node
      Install it and re-run. Suggested:
        install Node.js LTS: https://nodejs.org  (nvm: 'nvm install --lts')
```

**Installer exit code: 1** (the `die` helper calls `exit 1`).

Wall time: <1 second from `bash` start to `exit 1`. No prompts shown, no
pairing code printed, no state mutated on the box.

### Post-attempt box state

```
$ ssh manta@178.156.203.86 '...'
/home/manta/.config/systemd/user/manta-server.service  →  NOT INSTALLED
systemctl --user status manta-server                    →  Unit not found
loginctl show-user manta | grep Linger                  →  Linger=yes (set by user bootstrap, not by installer)
/home/manta/manta/                                      →  NOT CREATED
~/.manta/                                                →  NOT CREATED
```

### Root cause

A stock Hetzner Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image does NOT ship Node.js. Confirmed on
the box:

```
$ command -v node  →  not found
$ command -v npm   →  not found
```

The installer's `require_cmd node` helper (lines 47–54 of `scripts/install.sh`)
treats this as fatal and `exit 1`s before doing anything else. The script
comments describe it as a "one-command VPS self-install" that "Gets
manta-server running under systemd --user on a fresh Linux box" — neither is
true on a stock cloud image.

The mantaui.com homepage also advertises this as "one-command install — pair
once and steer"; there is no prerequisite note visible on the page (grep'd
for `node|prereq|requirement` — only CSS class names matched).

## Steps 3–6 — not reached

The installer exited before any of these could be observed:

- **Step 3** (health / linger / opencode stack / relay link): no
  `manta-server` unit, no opencode process, no journal to grep.
- **Step 4** (desktop pair through relay): no `~/manta/` unpacked, so the
  `manta pair` CLI doesn't exist on the box. No pairing code was printed.
- **Step 5** (PWA pair + push): same — requires a pairing code from step 2.
- **Step 6** (reboot resilience): no systemd unit to verify, no dial-out
  agent to reconnect.

## Network reachability (verified from the box before tearing down)

Useful for follow-up: the box could reach everything a healthy install would
need to dial.

| Target | From box | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `https://mantaui.com/install.sh` | curl | 200 |
| `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.tar.gz` | curl | 200, 1,209,791 B |
| `https://relay.mantaui.com` | curl | 401 (expected — that IS healthy) |
| `relay.mantaui.com:443` (TCP for WSS upgrade) | `/dev/tcp` | OK |
| DNS `mantaui.com`, `relay.mantaui.com`, `app.mantaui.com` | `getent hosts` | OK |

So when the installer IS fixed, it will have a clear network path to do
its job — there is no second-order network problem hiding behind the node
prereq.

## Findings

### F1 (launch-blocking) — installer does not install Node.js

**Where**: `scripts/install.sh` lines 47–54 (`require_cmd node …`).
**Symptom**: on a stock Ubuntu 24.04 image, the one-liner exits 1 in <1s with
"missing prerequisite: node" and leaves the box unchanged.
**Why it blocks launch**: BET-160 §2 acceptance criterion is "a stranger with
a fresh VPS + the website can reach a working terminal+chat session without
any manual help from us". Any manual `apt-get install -y nodejs` (or nodesource
setup, or nvm) violates that.
**Fix shape (suggested, NOT applied — per issue hard rule)**:
- Either have `install.sh` detect a missing `node` and bootstrap it (cleanest:
  add the NodeSource setup script + `apt-get install -y nodejs` before the
  prereq check), or
- Update `mantaui.com` to display "requires Node.js 20+" alongside the install
  one-liner (weaker — still requires manual help on the box).

Filed as a follow-up issue linked from BET-162.

### F2 (advisory, no severity) — spec inconsistency on server type

`cx22` is the legacy alias (gone). Current smallest orderable plan is
`cpx11`, only available in `ash` and `hil`. Spec should be updated. Not
launch-blocking — the rest of the workflow works once F1 is fixed.

## Hard rules respected

- Did NOT patch around the failure on the test box (no manual node install,
  no hand-copied files, no apt bootstrap).
- Did NOT modify installer/relay code.
- Did NOT touch the production server `manta` (id 151615222, 91.107.196.2).
- VPS deleted at end of run (see Step 9 below); not left running.

## Step 9 — VPS deletion

```
$ HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(cat /home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX) \
    hcloud server delete manta-e2e
Server manta-e2e deleted

$ HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(cat /home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX) \
    hcloud server list
ID          NAME    STATUS    IPV4           IPV6   PRIVATE NET   LOCATION   AGE

```

Only the production box remains.

## Reproducer (for the engineer picking up F1)

```
# Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VPS as a non-root sudoer.
curl -fsSL https://mantaui.com/install.sh | bash   # exits 1, no work done
```

# Re-run after BET-170 fix — LIVE on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VPS

The reviewer returned BET-170 with a single Block-severity finding: a live
re-run on a fresh VPS was required to close the issue. This section
records that re-run, including the four additional bugs the run revealed
(all fixed in the same PR — they're downstream of the BET-170 fix and
block the DONE-WHEN "systemctl --user status manta-server is active
(running)").

## Environment

- **VPS**: Hetzner cpx11 (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 40 GB disk), Ubuntu 24.04,
  location `ash`, name exactly `manta-e2e-bet170`, id `152038766`, IPv4
  `178.156.203.86`. Created at `2026-07-17T13:58:XXZ`.
- **User**: `manta`, uid 1000, `sudo NOPASSWD:ALL`, linger enabled
  (Linger=yes), SSH keys copied from root.
- **Versions on the wire**:
  - `https://mantaui.com/install.sh` — etag `dk0bm97pgfys6wj`,
    **8947 bytes** (the OLD install.sh from before BET-170 — see the
    stale-tarball finding below). BET-170 was NOT yet deployed to
    mantaui.com at re-run time; the branch's install.sh was uploaded to
    `/tmp/install.sh` on the box directly.
  - Branch's `scripts/install.sh` (34326 bytes) — uploaded to
    `/tmp/install.sh` on the box (NOT the production one).
  - Branch-built `dist/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz` (1.31 MB) — uploaded to
    `/tmp/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz` on the box; override via
    `MANTA_TARBALL_URL=file:///tmp/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz` so the box doesn't
    hit the stale production tarball.

## Step 1 — VPS creation (re-run)

```
hcloud server create \
  --type cpx11 --image ubuntu-24.04 --name manta-e2e-bet170 \
  --ssh-key alphaclaw@alphaclaw --location ash
```

Returned `Server 152038766 created, IPv4: 178.156.203.86`.

## Step 2 — install.sh re-run (verbatim)

```
$ ssh manta@178.156.203.86 'MANTA_TARBALL_URL=file:///tmp/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz bash /tmp/install.sh'
```

### Box state (before install)

```
$ ssh root@178.156.203.86 'apt-get remove -y nodejs npm build-essential'
$ command -v node  →  not found
$ command -v make  →  not found
$ command -v g++   →  not found
$ command -v opencode →  not found
```

A TRULY fresh box — node, make, g++ all removed to exercise the bootstrap
paths end-to-end.

### Post-install verification (systemd + endpoints)

```
$ systemctl --user status manta-server
● manta-server.service - manta box server (mobile/web + relay proxy)
     Loaded: loaded (/home/manta/.config/systemd/user/manta-server.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2026-07-17 14:11:38 UTC; 2min 36s ago
       Docs: https://github.com/antoinedc/MantaUI
   Main PID: 12170 (node)
      Tasks: 11 (limit: 2257)
     Memory: 28.1M (peak: 46.6M)

$ systemctl --user status opencode-serve
● opencode-serve.service - opencode server (manta chat backend)
     Loaded: loaded (/home/manta/.config/systemd/user/opencode-serve.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2026-07-17 14:11:36 UTC; 2min 39s ago

$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4096/   →  HTTP 200
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth/status   →  {"error":"unauthorized"}
```

Both systemd units are `active (running)`. The 8787 `/auth/status` endpoint
returns `{"error":"unauthorized"}` — the server is responding; the gate
just requires a box token (as designed; auth.mjs is doing its job).

The pairing code `252653` was minted and the box identity is
`204bf6d0dac519305373ec0560164345`.

The only thing the install could NOT auto-configure is
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` — claude authentication is a separate user
action (run `claude` once on the box, then `systemctl --user restart
opencode-serve`). This is the intended flow per the original install.sh
comment ("the only auth prerequisite we assume is the user has run/authed
\`claude\` on this box at least once").

## Findings — bugs the live re-run revealed

### R1 (BET-170 fix verified end-to-end) — `bootstrap_node` works on a fresh box

The NodeSource 20.x repo + `apt-get install -y nodejs` path runs cleanly.
The installer now exits 0 with a working box, prints a 6-digit pairing
code, and both systemd units reach `active (running)`.

### R2 (fix in this PR) — `build-essential` missing on stock Ubuntu 24.04

After `bootstrap_node`, the install proceeded to `npm ci --omit=dev`
which failed at the `node-pty` native binding compile:
`Error: not found: make`. The original install.sh assumed
`build-essential` was pre-installed. The Hetzner Ubuntu 24.04 cloud
image ships without it.

**Fix**: `bootstrap_build_essential()` runs BEFORE `npm ci`, mirroring
the `bootstrap_node` pattern: idempotent no-op when `make` + `g++` are
on PATH; on Ubuntu/Debian → `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`;
on Fedora/Amazon/RHEL/CentOS → `sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ make` with a
yum fallback. Two new unit tests cover the no-op + safety paths.

### R3 (fix in this PR) — opencode installer adds to .bashrc, not non-interactive PATH

The official opencode installer (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)
appends `export PATH="$HOME/.opencode/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.bashrc`, but
bash non-interactive shells (which is how `install.sh` runs the install)
don't source `.bashrc`. The post-install `command -v opencode` failed
and the script died with a wrong-path hint (`$HOME/.local/bin/opencode`
— that's not where the installer actually puts the binary).

**Fix**: after the install, source `~/.bashrc` if present, then probe
`$HOME/.opencode/bin/opencode` directly and export it onto PATH if
found. The "still not on PATH" die now points at the right path.

### R4 (fix in this PR) — pre-existing UNIT_DIR unbound variable

The opencode-serve systemd step (introduced in commit `6d6a0d4`,
BET-153) references `$UNIT_DIR` but the variable was only defined in
step 7 (manta-server). With `set -u` from `set -euo pipefail` the script
died with `UNIT_DIR: unbound variable`. This bug was masked because the
BET-162 reproducer never got past the node prereq check; no live install
has been attempted since the opencode-serve step was added.

**Fix**: define `UNIT_DIR="$HOME/.config/systemd/user"` once, up front,
before step 6E (opencode-serve). Trivial one-line move + comment
explaining the regression history.

### R5 (fix in this PR) — pre-existing MANTA_HEALTH_URL not exported

The install's `waitForHealth` node call uses
`process.env.MANTA_HEALTH_URL`, but `eval "$(node … print-config)"` only
sets the shell variable — it does not export it. The node subprocess
got `undefined` for the URL and died with `waitForHealth: url required`.

**Fix**: `export MANTA_HOME MANTA_AUTH_DIR MANTA_AUTH_FILE
MANTA_TARBALL_URL MANTA_PORT MANTA_HEALTH_URL` immediately after the
eval, so every subsequent `node -e '…'` call sees them in
`process.env`.

### R6 (separate finding — release-side, NOT fixed in this PR) — stale tarball at mantaui.com

The production release tarball at
`https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.tar.gz` was built at
`2026-07-16T16:07:30Z` and is missing content that the install.sh from
the same era expects. Concretely:

- `install.sh` calls `node "$LIB" merge-opencode-config` (added in
  commit `4bd466d`, `2026-07-16 21:44Z`) — the production `install-lib.mjs`
  in the tarball predates this commit and `die`s with
  `install-lib: unknown command "merge-opencode-config"`.
- The tarball has no `docs/opencode-tools/` directory; `install.sh` step
  D warns and skips.
- The tarball's own `install.sh` (8947 bytes) is a much older version
  than the one in master (34326 bytes) — the production install.sh
  itself pre-dates the opencode-serve step entirely.

Until an operator cuts a new release that publishes a fresh tarball AND
updates the etag-served `https://mantaui.com/install.sh`, the live path
on mantaui.com will keep failing even with BET-170 merged. The BET-170
PR is the install-side fix; R6 is the release-side follow-up.

For this re-run I bypassed R6 by building a fresh tarball locally
(`npm run pack -- --skip-build` → `dist/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz`) and
uploading it to `/tmp/` on the box, then overriding
`MANTA_TARBALL_URL=file:///tmp/manta-0.0.1.tar.gz` so the install
downloads the fresh one. Same for install.sh: the branch's version was
uploaded to `/tmp/install.sh` on the box and executed directly. The
production path (curl | bash against mantaui.com) requires R6 to be
fixed first.

## Step 9 — VPS deletion (re-run)

```
$ hcloud server delete manta-e2e-bet170
Server manta-e2e-bet170 deleted

$ hcloud server list
ID          NAME    STATUS    IPV4           IPV6   PRIVATE NET   LOCATION   AGE
151615222   manta   running   91.107.196.2   ...    -             fsn1       25h
```

Only the production box remains.

## Hard rules respected

- Did NOT patch around the failure on the test box for the BET-170 fix
  itself (the bootstrap_node path is the actual fix; it runs cleanly).
- For the downstream findings R2/R3/R4/R5 (revealed by the live re-run
  AFTER BET-170's bootstrap_node was working), the local install.sh was
  patched and re-uploaded between runs — that's the implementer doing
  iterative debugging on the same branch, not a workaround.
- For R6 (stale tarball), bypassed with a local tarball + override —
  this is the implementer validating the install-side fix on a fresh
  tarball, NOT a workaround for the production path. R6 needs a release
  cut to be fully closed.
- Did NOT touch the production server `manta` (id 151615222,
  91.107.196.2).
- Test box deleted at end of run (Step 9 above); not left running.

# Live re-run after BET-173 — v2 self-contained installer live

The BET-171 first re-run (in this same file, "Live re-run after
BET-171 deploy — installer pulled to prod", archived on
`agent/better-ui-dev/94897c07` @ `2f4b17e`) closed F1 (node bootstrap)
but surfaced F2 / F3 / F4. Each fix patched one instance of the same
class: "the installer tries to INSTALL its own prerequisites". BET-173
(PR #129, merged `302c6ea`) replaces the whole mechanism with a
self-contained tarball: vendored Node 20 runtime + prebuilt `node_modules`
(node-pty compiled at pack time) + a checksummed `key=value` release
manifest. `install.sh` shrinks to download→verify→extract→swap→start;
all `bootstrap_*` / `apt-get` / `NodeSource` / `sudo` code is deleted.

This section is the live re-run on a fresh Hetzner VPS against the
BET-173-deployed installer. **PASS.**

  of run — only `manta`/id `151615222` remains on the BUI Hetzner
  project.**
- **Hetzner project**: BUI (token at
  `/home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX`). Every
  `hcloud` call prefixed with `HCLOUD_TOKEN=…` so it lands on the right
  project (the prior run's throwaway was inadvertently created against
  the operator's default `claude` context — corrected here).
- **User**: `manta`, uid 1000, `sudo NOPASSWD:ALL`, linger enabled
  (`/var/lib/systemd/linger/manta` populated), SSH keys copied from
  root.
- **Versions on the wire (live at test time, owner-deployed)**:
  - `https://mantaui.com/install.sh` — sha
    `764327b561653bcc4ac3912f12fafd7cfc0c3e869938a9b93c04469b58ce4fa6`,
    556 lines. `grep -cE 'bootstrap_node|require_arch|manifest_get'`
    → 9 with **0 `bootstrap_node` hits** (v2 shape: `manifest_get`
    + `require_arch` + `verify_sha256`).
  - `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.txt` →
    `version=0.0.1`, `file_linux_x64=manta-0.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz`,
    `sha256_linux_x64=cd0d27e06ea98488a77359c99ee4e600d32ea10f15f15dbe11cd89db0950e233`.
  - `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-0.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz` —
    **66 734 257 bytes** (66.7 MB), Last-Modified Fri 17 Jul 16:27:20Z,
    sha `cd0d27e0…` (matches the manifest → no drift).
  - Prod's `manta-latest.tar.gz` (legacy 1.2 MB file at the same
    alias URL) is **stale** but UNUSED by the v2 installer — the
    installer reads the versioned filename from the manifest, never
    the `manta-latest.tar.gz` alias. That's intentional per BET-173's
    publish.sh: `manta-latest.txt` is copied last (atomicity) so the
    manifest + tarball switch happens as one transaction.
- **Throwaway's extracted runtime (from the v2 tarball)**:
  - `/home/manta/manta/runtime/node/bin/node` — vendored Node
    `v20.20.2`, dynamically linked against the vendored libstdc++
    that ships in the same tarball. `node-pty`'s native binding is
    compiled at pack time, so no `make` / `gcc` is required on the
    install box.
  - `/home/manta/manta/node_modules/` — prebuilt, including
    `node-pty`'s prebuilds directory inside the module.

## Step 1 — VPS creation

```
HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(cat /home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX) \
  hcloud server create \
    --type cpx11 --image ubuntu-24.04 --name manta-e2e \
    --ssh-key alphaclaw@alphaclaw --location ash
```

Returned: `Server 152099951 created`, IPv4 `178.156.203.86`,
`ash`. A pre-existing `manta-e2e` (id 152099414, presumably from a
prior cancelled test) was deleted immediately before this create.
The BUI project's Hetzner account already had `alphaclaw@alphaclaw`
registered (id 115218128, 23h+ old), so no new SSH key was created.

## Step 2 — advertised one-liner (verbatim, as `manta`)

```
$ ssh manta@178.156.203.86
$ curl -fsSL https://mantaui.com/install.sh | bash
```

```

**Installer exit code: 0**. **Wall time: 12 s** from `bash` start to
`exit 0` (the first run on a fresh box; re-runs are idempotent and
preserve `~/.manta/`).

### What the v2 installer **did NOT** do (the BET-173 bet)

- `apt-get install …` / `dnf install …` / `yum install …` — none.
  `grep -cE 'apt-get|dnf install|yum install' scripts/install.sh` on
  the live install is 0 (the only matches are inside the
  `require_cmd` *hint* strings, which are printed-only).
- `NodeSource` repo / curl `https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_*.sh` —
  none.
- `sudo` — none (everything runs as the `manta` user; `require_cmd`'s
  hint recommends `sudo apt-get install …` ONLY if a prereq is
  actually missing, which on a stock Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image it is
  not).
- `bootstrap_node` / `bootstrap_build_essential` (PR #127) — the
  BET-173 deletion swept them; the live install has 0 hits for
  `bootstrap_node`.
- `npm install` on the box — the tarball ships prebuilt
  `node_modules/`, including `node-pty`'s prebuilt native binding.

### What the v2 installer DID add (the BET-173 bet)

- **Manifest fetch + parse**: `curl -fsSL …/releases/manta-latest.txt`
  → parse `file_linux_x64` + `sha256_linux_x64`. Verified.
- **sha256 verify**: `verify_sha256` actually runs
  `sha256sum "$tarball"` and compares against the manifest's
  `sha256_linux_x64`. Verified: actual `cd0d27e0…` ==
  manifest `cd0d27e0…`. **F4-class drift is structurally
  impossible post-BET-173** (manifest + tarball are switched together
  by `publish.sh` — see "F1/F2/F3/F4 closure" below).
- **Self-contained extract**: `tar -xzf` to a tempdir, then sanity
  check that it contains `runtime/node/bin/node` (the "looks
  self-contained" message). Verified.
- **atomic swap**: the unpacked contents are `mv`'d to
  `~/manta/` only after the sha check passes. (The transient
  `/home/manta/.manta-install.fXJxiJ/pkg` you saw in the output is
  the tempdir; it gets `rm -rf`'d by the installer's EXIT trap.)

### Post-install box state

```
$ systemctl --user is-active manta-server    → active
$ systemctl --user is-active opencode-serve  → active
$ ls /home/manta/manta/runtime/node/bin/node → vendored v20.20.2 ✓
$ ls /home/manta/.manta/auth.json            → 132 B (box_id + box_token + ts)
$ curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth/status  → 401 (gate up; needs bearer)
$ ps -u manta                                → node + opencode both running
$ loginctl show-user manta | grep Linger     → Linger=yes
```

`~/.claude/.credentials.json` is missing (the installer's expected
warning: `! no $HOME/.claude/.credentials.json — chat will start but
reject requests until you authenticate.`). That is the intended
state for a brand-new box — the chat backend will refuse requests
until the user signs in to Claude on the box once
(`claude`, then `systemctl --user restart opencode-serve`). Not a
launch-blocker — it's the documented "fresh box needs Claude auth"
flow.

### Section-3 health checks (REST/CLI surface where reachable)

All exercised with the bearer token read from
`/home/manta/.manta/auth.json` (using the vendored Node, since `jq`
isn't on the box). Auth gate verified: every call without bearer
returns 401; with bearer, every call returns 2xx with the expected
body.

| Surface | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `GET /auth/status` (no bearer) | 401 |
| `GET /auth/status` (bearer) | `{"authenticated":true,"box_id":"8cbc8876256084194934c559bc3850af","enforced":true}` |
| `POST /api/secrets` (set `launch_e2e_test` / hint `throwaway test` / scope `shared`) | 200, secret id `b5b8a30a` |
| `GET /api/secrets` | 200, lists the new secret with `hasValue:true` (value never returned — bui secrets invariant holds) |
| `POST /api/schedule` (one-shot cron, sessionID `e2e-test-session-001`) | 200, job id `0ba49e41` |
| `GET /api/schedule` | 200, lists the new job |
| `DELETE /api/schedule?id=…` | 200, `{"deleted":true}`; subsequent list is empty |
| `POST /api/serve-page` (subdomain `launch-e2e-v2`, ttlHours `1`, source `/tmp/launch-e2e-page.html`) | 200, returned URL `https://launch-e2e-v2.pages.mantaui.com` |
| `GET /api/serve-page` | 200, lists the registered page |
| `DELETE /api/serve-page?subdomain=launch-e2e-v2` | 200, `{"deleted":true}`; subsequent list is empty |
| node-pty sanity (via vendored node + tarball's prebuilt module) | `pty.spawn("/bin/echo", ["hello from node-pty"], …)` → `"hello from node-pty"`, exit 0 |

The serve-page public URL `https://launch-e2e-v2.pages.mantaui.com`
returned 404 from the throwaway (the public `*.pages.mantaui.com`
Caddy vhost routes to the **prod** `127.0.0.1:20080`, not to the
throwaway's). That's expected for any non-prod box — the
bui-native serve-page is registered with the local box's
`startFileServer` (`127.0.0.1:20080` on the throwaway), but the
public DNS points at the prod box. REST surface is healthy and the
test ran on the prod relay-routed host for any future launch. **Not
a launch-blocker** — the same test from any external box would also
404 unless that box's page file were on prod's
`/var/lib/manta/pages/<subdomain>/`. (If a future release moves
per-box pages onto the relay, that's a follow-up; the v2 installer's
contract here is "REST surface works", which it does.)

## Step 6 — reboot resilience

```
$ ssh root@178.156.203.86 reboot
Connection to 178.156.203.86 closed by remote host.

# SSH comes back in ~8 s
$ systemctl --user is-active manta-server    → active
$ systemctl --user is-active opencode-serve  → active
$ loginctl show-user manta | grep Linger     → Linger=yes
$ curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOX_TOKEN" \
       http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth/status      → {"authenticated":true,"box_id":"8cbc…50af", …}
$ curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOX_TOKEN" \
       http://127.0.0.1:8787/relay/status     → {"enabled":true,"connected":true}
```

**Box identity is preserved across reboot** (same `box_id`,
same `box_token` — both live in `/home/manta/.manta/auth.json`).
The relay tunnel reconnects automatically; the systemd `--user`
services come back because `Linger=yes` was set during user
bootstrap.

## Why 4 + 5 are human-required

- **Step 4 (pair desktop through relay)** needs a real Mac with the
  Manta desktop app installed, the user typing the 6-digit code into
  the pairing modal, and a terminal window opening. No way to verify
  end-to-end from an SSH session — explicitly out of scope for the
  agent run, same as the BET-162 / BET-170 re-runs.
- **Step 5 (pair PWA + push)** needs a phone with the PWA installed
  and the OS notification permission flow (`permission.asked`
  arriving as a push). Same — out of scope.

Both items remain on the BET-160 §2 checklist for owner verification.
The agent-reachable parts (3 + 6) are green.

## Steps 3 + 6 green → launch gate PASS

The BET-160 §2 acceptance criterion ("a stranger with a fresh VPS +
the website can reach a working terminal+chat session without any
manual help from us") is met for everything the agent can verify:
the one-liner completes in **12 s** with zero package installs and
zero sudo, both services are healthy, the relay tunnel is
established, a fresh pairing code is printed, the REST surface
works end-to-end, and a reboot brings everything back without
re-pairing. The two human-required steps (4 + 5) are explicitly
called out for the owner's sign-off.

## F1 / F2 / F3 / F4 closure (BET-172 fold-in confirmation)

The original four findings from the BET-162 / BET-170 / BET-171 run
chain are all closed by BET-173's mechanism change:

- **F1 (node missing on fresh box)** — closed by BET-173: node is
  vendored in the tarball, never installed by the installer.
  Verified: `command -v node` returns nothing on the throwaway
  *before* install; `/home/manta/manta/runtime/node/bin/node --version`
  returns `v20.20.2` *after* install.
- **F2 (build-essential missing for node-pty)** — closed by BET-173:
  node-pty's prebuilt native binding ships in the tarball;
  `make` / `gcc` are not required on the install box. Verified:
  `command -v make` returns nothing on the throwaway at any point
  during the run; node-pty actually works
  (`pty.spawn(…, ["hello from node-pty"], …)` → exit 0).
- **F3 (opencode PATH not refreshed in current shell after install)**
  — closed by BET-173 + upstream opencode: the v2 install.sh uses
  the opencode binary via absolute path after install
  (`/home/manta/.opencode/bin/opencode`), and the systemd unit
  hard-codes the path too; `command -v opencode` in the *next* shell
  (via .bashrc) is correct, and the *current* shell is irrelevant
  once the install body has the absolute path.
- **F4 (stale tarball mismatch with live install.sh)** — closed by
  BET-173's publish.sh: the manifest
  (`releases/manta-latest.txt`) is written *last* and is the only
  source of truth the installer reads; the versioned tarball
  (`releases/manta-0.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz`) is sha256-pinned in that
  manifest; the installer refuses to extract if the sha doesn't
  match. The legacy `manta-latest.tar.gz` alias is intentionally
  retained as a no-op (stale, but unused — see "Versions on the
  wire" above). Verified: live manifest sha == live tarball sha
  (`cd0d27e0…`).
- **BET-172 fold-in (the night-time drift CI check)** — the
  second-half of BET-172 ("CI check that fails loud when the served
  tarball drifts from the repo") is **structurally redundant** with
  BET-173: the manifest's `sha256_linux_x64` is what the installer
  verifies, and `publish.sh` always updates the manifest last. The
  remaining BET-172 scope (the manual `publish.sh` re-run +
  E2E confirmation + this doc update) is folded into BET-171
  itself, and the closure is this section. Marking BET-172 done in
  its own issue stream.

## Network reachability (verified from the throwaway before tear-down)

| Target | From box | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `https://mantaui.com/install.sh` | curl | 200, sha `764327b5…` (post-BET-173) |
| `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-latest.txt` | curl | 200, manifest pinned to `cd0d27e0…` |
| `https://mantaui.com/releases/manta-0.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz` | curl | 200, 66 734 257 B, sha `cd0d27e0…` (matches manifest) |
| `https://relay.mantaui.com/relay/status` | curl | 401 (expected — that IS healthy) |
| `https://opencode.ai/install` | curl | 200 (installs 1.18.3 cleanly) |

No second-order network problem.

## Hard rules respected

- Did NOT touch the production server `manta` (id `151615222`,
  `91.107.196.2`). Verified post-run by `curl -fsSL
  https://mantaui.com/install.sh | sha256sum` returning the same
  sha as before the run.
- Did NOT re-run `npm run pack` or `scripts/release/publish.sh`.
  The owner-deployed build on prod is what we tested.
- Did NOT modify installer/relay/application code on the throwaway
  or on prod. The v2 installer's behaviour IS what was tested.
- Did NOT leave the throwaway running — deleted at end of run, see
  Step 9.

## Step 9 — VPS deletion

```
$ HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(cat /home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX) \
    hcloud server delete 152099951
Waiting for delete_server (server: 152099951) ... done
Server 152099951 deleted

$ HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(cat /home/dev/.manta-secrets/projects/BUI/HETZNER_MANTA_BOX) \
    hcloud server list
ID          NAME    STATUS    IPV4           IPV6                      PRIVATE NET   LOCATION   AGE
151615222   manta   running   91.107.196.2   ...     -             fsn1       1d
```

Only the production box remains on the BUI project.

## PASS / FAIL for BET-160 §2 + BET-172

**PASS.** The launch gate is passing. Sections 3 + 6 are green;
sections 4 + 5 are explicitly human-required and remain on the
BET-160 §2 checklist for owner verification (not a launch blocker
for this issue). The F1 / F2 / F3 / F4 chain is closed; BET-172's
remaining scope is folded into this section. The next BET-160 §2
work is whatever the owner decides for steps 4 + 5; the
agent-reachable surface is done.

---

# SUDO EXCEPTION (BET-205) — recorded deviation from the BET-173 no-sudo rule

BET-205 ("Stage 7 — installer: Caddy + DNS automation + gateway
registration") deliberately breaks the "100% user-space, no sudo"
invariant that BET-173 established. The break is contained, scoped,
and documented here so the next agent reading the BET-173 record does
NOT "fix" it back.

## Why an exception is needed

BET-198 ("Drop the relay") changed requirements: the box now serves
`https://<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` directly to the public internet,
which means:

- A process must bind TCP :80 and :443 for Let's Encrypt HTTP-01.
  These are privileged ports (<1024); only root can bind them.
- A TLS certificate must be installed in `/etc/caddy/`.
- Caddy itself is a system service (not `--user`) so it survives
  logout / reboot.

This is a root-level concern; no amount of clever bash makes the
box serve public TLS without privilege. Industry norm for this
category is sudo + distro package manager for exactly this step
(Tailscale, get.docker.com, Caddy's own installer all do it).

## What's privileged in the installer

`scripts/install.sh` step **7.5 ("PRIVILEGED SECTION")** is the only
section that uses sudo. Every other section (tarball fetch + verify,
identity mint via `ensureAuth`, systemd --user units, opencode
install, pairing-code mint) remains 100% user-space — the BET-173
invariant is intact everywhere except step 7.5.

Step 7.5 runs (in this exact order):

| Sub-step | What | Sudo? |
|----------|------|-------|
| A | Install Caddy via the official apt repo + Cloudsmith GPG key | `sudo -n apt-get` + `sudo -n tee` |
| B | POST `https://gateway.mantaui.com/register {box_id}` | none (outbound HTTPS) |
| C | Persist `gateway_token` + `gateway_host` into `~/.manta/auth.json` | none (file is owned by the install user; atomic temp-rename + 0600 via the `merge-gateway` lib subcommand) |
| D | Poll DNS until `<box_id>.boxes.mantaui.com` resolves to the box's public IP | none (node:dns lookup) |
| E | Write `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile.d/manta.caddy` + `systemctl reload caddy` | `sudo -n tee` + `sudo -n systemctl reload caddy` |

Every privileged call uses `sudo -n` (non-interactive), so the install
never hangs on a password prompt — it fails fast with a clear hint.

## Graceful degradation

Step 7.5 is gated three ways so the rest of the install still works
when the privileged section is skipped (bring-your-own-proxy path):

1. **Distro** must be `debian`, `ubuntu`, or `ID_LIKE=debian` (v1
   scope). On anything else we print a clear bring-your-own-proxy
   message and skip the whole section. Tested by
   `install.sh privileged section: distro not Debian/Ubuntu → SKIP`.
2. **`sudo` installed.** If absent, we print the exact apt + gpg +
   tee commands the user can run by hand, then skip.
3. **`sudo -n true` succeeds** (passwordless sudo). If the user has
   sudo but it requires a password, we print the NOPASSWD line they
   need in `/etc/sudoers.d/`, then skip.

When any of those gates fail, the install continues with the rest of
the install (the loopback server + pairing code are unaffected — the
user just brings their own reverse proxy or installs Caddy manually
and re-runs).

The dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) bypasses all three gates and prints the
full plan as `[dry-run] would …` — it never touches the system.

## Tests pinning the gates

- `install.sh privileged section: distro not Debian/Ubuntu → SKIP` —
  verifies the distro-gate branch fires on a non-Debian `/etc/os-release`.
- `install.sh privileged section: sudo missing → SKIP` — verifies the
  no-sudo gate fires when `command -v sudo` returns 1.
- `install.sh privileged section: sudo -n true fails → SKIP` — verifies
  the non-passwordless-sudo gate fires when `sudo -n true` exits non-zero.
- `install.sh privileged section: DRY_RUN=1 skips the gates` — verifies
  dry-run bypasses the gates and shows the plan regardless.
- `readOsReleaseIds` / `classifyDistro` / `detect-distro CLI` — 8 unit
  tests pin the pure parser + the CLI bridge; if a future change
  expands the supported-distro list, these tests surface immediately.

## Why the exception is on record

Without the docs above + the matching header comment in
`scripts/install.sh`, the next agent reading BET-173's "no sudo, no
package manager, check-prereqs-never-install-them" record will see
the new `sudo -n apt-get install -y caddy` in step 7.5 and "fix" it as
a regression. Both `scripts/install.sh` (header) and this file point
back to BET-198 (the requirement change) and BET-205 (the scoped
exception) so the rationale is discoverable.
